# Modernize Apps Labs

In this lab you will get familiar with the OpenShift CLI and OpenShift Web Console and get ready for the Application Modernization labs.

This workshop has 5 exercises in total.

**01-moving-existing-apps.md**:
 Migrate (lift & shift) an existing Java EE app to EAP using Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit (RHAMT) and deploy it to OpenShift

**02-developer-intro.md**: 
 This lab is more about how to use the OpenShift Container Platform as a developer to build and deploy applications. We'll focus on the core features of OpenShift as it relates to developers, and you'll learn typical workflows for a developer (develop, build, test, deploy, and repeat).
After lab 2 we will start Modernizing the application by breaking the application into multiple microservices using different technologies

**03-mono-to-micro-part-1.md**:

This scenario is more about Thorntail, one of the runtimes included in Red Hat Runtimes. You will implement one component of the monolith as a Thorntail microservice and deploy it to OpenShift.

**03-mono-to-micro-part-2.md** : 
In this scenario, you will create the catalog service (SpringBoot Framework) and deploy to OpenShift.

**04-reactive-microservices.md** :
This lab is more about Reactive Microservices using Eclipse Vert.x, one of the runtimes included in Red Hat Runtimes. We will create three different services that interact using an EventBus which also does a REST call to the CatalogService we built in the previous steps. We will also create a Microservice for tracking the popular items.

Let's start!
